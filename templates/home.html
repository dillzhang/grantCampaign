	  Determination and intelligence are not powerful enough words to describe Rahul Debnath, a unique adolescent. Rahul Debnath is far from a conformist. Although he is much regimented, Mr. Debnath speaks his mind and transgresses boundaries. He relishes in taking extra steps forward, not only to achieve his goals, but to accomplish and learn passed the minimum requirements. Never complaining about the stress he faces in his everyday itinerary, he tackles problems with an optimistic outlook. He is always a great pleasure to be around and constantly puts others before himself. It appears that helping others is what he prioritizes. Rahul Debnath is far ordinary due to his extremely altruistic, committed, and courageous character. 
	 <br> Rahul Debnath grew up in an immigrant family. He was the first to be born in America, which is why he is expected to accomplish great achievements by his relatives. This pressure was upon Mr. Debnath even before he entered any educational institution; however, Rahul embraces the hardships he has faced as a child, because it has helped shape his current habits. Diligence is a trait also passed down throughout generations of his family. Both his parents worked two jobs when he was a child, which led him to become very independent. It is quite scarce to stumble upon a student with such idiosyncratic traits. His optimism, wisdom, and altruism go well-beyond his years. These characteristics have assisted Mr. Debnath in narrowing his career choices. Rahul intends to leave an impact on his environment and colleagues, which is why he either wants to enter the field of medicine or guidance. Mr. Debnath has a fond attitude towards teaching, but he loves strenuous activities and tasks as well.

	  <li id="dt1" style="cursor:pointer;"> Deprivatization of Prisons </li>
	  <ul id="dd1" style="display: none;">
	    <li>  Deprivatization of prisons, also known as the abolition of the prison industrial complex, is a problem that won’t be solved with any easy, currently foreseeable solution. It maintains the influence of the private companies through perpetuating negative stereotypes of race, ethnicity, class, etc. It is also incredibly profitable for these companies as well. The prison industrial complex can also eliminate oppressed groups that voice social or political dissent. Nearly 7 million adult citizens were under correctional supervision (2.8% of pop.). 2.2 million are currently in prison, the highest count in the world despite having only 5% of world’s population. There are a few plans that can be implemented to address the problem. First we can find a way to take the assets invested into prisons by corporations and private companies and have the federal government manage them. This would create new federal jobs, a uniform standard of treatment of prisoners, less sway over politics by private companies. Another solution, which is like a compromise, is to get the government to get more involved in regulating these prisons. The federal government can oversee the bureaucratic aspects of the prison industrial complex and manage it without losing complete support of private companies. We can also find new ways to adequately punish so as to reduce the population in prisons. Whether it is giving minor offenders community service and house arrest or drafting new laws to protect locals better, most solutions don’t need a prison.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <li id="dt2" style="cursor:pointer;"> College Debt </li>
	  <ul id="dd2" style="display: none;">
	    <li> Today, more Americans are faced with crushing college debt. Today, more Americans are faced with the fear of rampaging gun violence. Today more Americans are faced with insanely high prices for electricity, gas, and other natural resources. It is today that you can decide whether or not you want to change these things. It is today that we take an active role as Americans in molding our own destiny.<br>
	      In America, higher education opens the doors of opportunity for all. A typical American with a Bachelor’s Degree or higher makes over 28,000 dollars a year more than someone with a high school education. We all know that higher education is a smart investment, but a large percentage of families can’t invest their money upfront. These Americans in search of more opportunity have to resort to loans which turn into the burden of debt. I plan to lift the financial burden of student loans by making tuition free at public colleges and universities. I will also stop the federal government from making a profit on student loans and instead use the money to lower student loan interest rates significantly so that those who wish to go to private schools won’t face crippling debt. </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <li id="dt3" style="cursor:pointer;"> Gun Control </li>
	  <ul id="dd3" style="display: none;">
	    <li> In 2015 we have had more mass shootings than days in the year so far. Everyday someone’s life has been affected by gun violence and this phenomenon needs to stop. I plan to put an end to gun violence by imposing stronger gun control laws such as more stringent background checks. In addition, no one on the “no-fly” list should be able to buy a gun. If there is a “no-fly” list there should be a corresponding “no-buy” list. I also believe that if someone wants to purchase a firearm they should have required training before being eligible to bear one. This is how we will ensure proper handling of a firearm like we ensure proper driving by enforcing a required road test. </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <li id="dt4" style="cursor:pointer;"> Climate Change </li>
	  <ul id="dd4" style="display: none;">
	    <li> Climate change is real and as humans we have exacerbated global warming and cooling cycles through burning fossil fuels and releasing large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In order to combat climate change I will invest in the development of alternative energy so that we can preserve our natural resources and end our dependence on fossil fuels.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <li id="dt5" style="cursor:pointer;"> Campaign Spending Restrictions  </li>
	  <ul id="dd5" style="display: none;">
	    <li> Campaign spending is the involvement of money in politics especially in political campaigns. Currently, the limit per individual is $2600 and the national party may give $5000 to a candidate come election time, but after the Supreme Court ruling on April 2, 2014, the restrictions became looser. Those restrictions still need to be followed, but there is no longer an overall cap (used to be $123,200) to how much can be donated to the candidate and party. The first part of our solution is to overrule the McCutcheon vs Federal Election Committee decision by either stacking the court with a justice or gaining control of Congress. Neither will be easy, but after it is done, we can overrule the precedent and work on setting on restrictions that will be enforced better. Smaller solutions can include taxing contributors who give to multiple candidates in the same party, so as to bypass the limit, or only allowing an individual to give a certain amount of money to a predetermined number of candidates. What the Grant administration believes is that one of the principle ideas of democracy is allowing people to voice their opinions without being drowned out and excessive campaign spending attacks that spirit of democracy.

	  <ul id="fd1" style="display: none;">
	    <li>
	      We will continue trade and diplomatic relations with Taiwan and China in the hopes that they will continue making the strides they have been in civil rights reform.They seem to be going in the right direction, but if, for some reason, they deviate from their current trajectory, we will be taking definitive action. Even when considering that they are one of the fastest growing markets in the world with such economic power, we will not hesitate to cut all ties with them. Also, our trade with China has become so one-sided due to unfair trade practices that would be otherwise illegal due to free trade sanctions. So we will be working to address that while we maintain our relationship with them so that we can usher in an era of mutual prosperity.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <li id="ft2" style="cursor:pointer;"> Isis </li>
	  <ul id="fd2" style="display: none;">
	    <li>
	      Our policy on dealing with ISIS is to continue carefully monitoring their activities and the activities of countries suspected of aiding their operations. If countries are suspected of aiding ISIS and this aid is confirmed, we will freeze their assets in the United States and various other countries around the world. Also, in order to keep them under control, we will enlist the help of countries in the area and fund them so that they can prevent ISIS’ influence from spreading. This will prevent us from putting boots on the ground so as to minimize danger posed to our troops. It also prevents any senseless tension between our troops and the natives. As a final point, we will slowly stamp out ISIS by working with the locals and strangle out any assets they have.

	  <li id="ft3" style="cursor:pointer;"> Latin America and Immigration </li>
	  <ul id="fd3" style="display: none;">
	    <li>
	      Our plan is to set up camps in specific areas to help immigrants, legal or illegal, settle into the country. These camps will help them find work and give them a proper place to stay, like in housing projects. These immigrants can help with public service projects that we will fund, which will help build infrastructure and give them a chance to make a living in the United States. It would be infeasible to admit every immigrant into the country but we will try to make the screening process much faster and less selective. All things considered, more immigrants helps our economy as they can help with infrastructure projects and agriculture. We plan to also offer them citizenship in the States after working a set amount of years, perhaps 5-10 years.
