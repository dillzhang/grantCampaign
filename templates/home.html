	  <li id="dt1"> Deprivatization of Prisons </li>
	  <ul id="dd1" style="display: none;">
	    <li>  Deprivatization of prisons, also known as the abolition of the prison industrial complex, is a problem that won’t be solved with any easy, currently foreseeable solution. It maintains the influence of the private companies through perpetuating negative stereotypes of race, ethnicity, class, etc. It is also incredibly profitable for these companies as well. The prison industrial complex can also eliminate oppressed groups that voice social or political dissent. Nearly 7 million adult citizens were under correctional supervision (2.8% of pop.). 2.2 million are currently in prison, the highest count in the world despite having only 5% of world’s population. There are a few plans that can be implemented to address the problem. First we can find a way to take the assets invested into prisons by corporations and private companies and have the federal government manage them. This would create new federal jobs, a uniform standard of treatment of prisoners, less sway over politics by private companies. Another solution, which is like a compromise, is to get the government to get more involved in regulating these prisons. The federal government can oversee the bureaucratic aspects of the prison industrial complex and manage it without losing complete support of private companies. We can also find new ways to adequately punish so as to reduce the population in prisons. Whether it is giving minor offenders community service and house arrest or drafting new laws to protect locals better, most solutions don’t need a prison.

	  <li id="dt2"> College Debt </li>
	  <ul id="dd2" style="display: none;">
	    <li> Today, more Americans are faced with crushing college debt. Today, more Americans are faced with the fear of rampaging gun violence. Today more Americans are faced with insanely high prices for electricity, gas, and other natural resources. It is today that you can decide whether or not you want to change these things. It is today that we take an active role as Americans in molding our own destiny.<br>
	      In America, higher education opens the doors of opportunity for all. A typical American with a Bachelor’s Degree or higher makes over 28,000 dollars a year more than someone with a high school education. We all know that higher education is a smart investment, but a large percentage of families can’t invest their money upfront. These Americans in search of more opportunity have to resort to loans which turn into the burden of debt. I plan to lift the financial burden of student loans by making tuition free at public colleges and universities. I will also stop the federal government from making a profit on student loans and instead use the money to lower student loan interest rates significantly so that those who wish to go to private schools won’t face crippling debt. </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <li id="dt3"> Gun Control </li>
	  <ul id="dd3" style="display: none;">
	    <li> In 2015 we have had more mass shootings than days in the year so far. Everyday someone’s life has been affected by gun violence and this phenomenon needs to stop. I plan to put an end to gun violence by imposing stronger gun control laws such as more stringent background checks. In addition, no one on the “no-fly” list should be able to buy a gun. If there is a “no-fly” list there should be a corresponding “no-buy” list. I also believe that if someone wants to purchase a firearm they should have required training before being eligible to bear one. This is how we will ensure proper handling of a firearm like we ensure proper driving by enforcing a required road test. </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <li id="dt4"> Climate Change </li>
	  <ul id="dd4" style="display: none;">
	    <li> Climate change is real and as humans we have exacerbated global warming and cooling cycles through burning fossil fuels and releasing large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In order to combat climate change I will invest in the development of alternative energy so that we can preserve our natural resources and end our dependence on fossil fuels.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <li id="dt5"> Campaign Spending Restrictions  </li>
	  <ul id="dd5" style="display: none;">
	    <li> Campaign spending is the involvement of money in politics especially in political campaigns. Currently, the limit per individual is $2600 and the national party may give $5000 to a candidate come election time, but after the Supreme Court ruling on April 2, 2014, the restrictions became looser. Those restrictions still need to be followed, but there is no longer an overall cap (used to be $123,200) to how much can be donated to the candidate and party. The first part of our solution is to overrule the McCutcheon vs Federal Election Committee decision by either stacking the court with a justice or gaining control of Congress. Neither will be easy, but after it is done, we can overrule the precedent and work on setting on restrictions that will be enforced better. Smaller solutions can include taxing contributors who give to multiple candidates in the same party, so as to bypass the limit, or only allowing an individual to give a certain amount of money to a predetermined number of candidates. What the Grant administration believes is that one of the principle ideas of democracy is allowing people to voice their opinions without being drowned out and excessive campaign spending attacks that spirit of democracy.
